| O(1)       	| Constant time 	| Looking up a single elemente in array                                                	| Big-O of one.<br>Essentially that means that the operation in question<br>doesn't depend on the number of elements in the given data set. <br>So a good example of this is calculating whether a number is even or odd,<br>or looking up a specific element index in an array                                                                                                                                                                                                                       	|
| O(log n)   	| Logarithmic   	| Finding an item in a sorted array with a binary search                               	| Log n which is called logarithmic time.                                  <br>And a typical example of this kind of operation is finding               <br>a specific value in a sorted array using a binary search.                <br>So as the number of items in the sorted array grows,                     <br>it only takes a logarithmic time relationship to find any given item                                                                                                            	|

| O(n log n) 	| Log-Linear    	| Complex sorting algorithms like heap sort and merged sort                            	| Order of n times log n or what's called log-linear time complexity.<br>And some good examples of this kind of operation                   <br>are some sorting algorithms like heap sort and merge sort                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             	|
| O(nÂ²)      	| Quadratic     	| Simple sorting algorithms.<br>Such as bubble sort, selection sort and insertion sort 	| Order of n squared, which is called quadratic time complexity,                  <br>and as you've probably guessed it's not a very good level of performance,       <br>because what that means is that as the number of items in the data set increases<br>the time it takes to process them increases at the square of that number.       <br>So some examples of this type of operation are some of the simpler              <br>sorting algorithms like the bubble sort and the selection sort. 	|
